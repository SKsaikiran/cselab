|**Program 4**|
|:------------------|
|**4. Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n > 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus n on graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.**|
