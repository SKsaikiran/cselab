## Question - Design, Develop and Implement a program in C for the following operations on Strings

a. Read a Main String (STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP).

b. Perform Pattern Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in STR with REP if 
PAT exists in STR. Repost suitable messages in case PAT does not exist in STR.

Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Donâ€™t use built-in functions.

## ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT:

**Strings** are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a **null** character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprCSE the string followed by a null .The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the **null** character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."

##### char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};

If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows:

##### char greeting[] = "Hello";

#### C language supports a wide range of built-in functions that manipulate null-terminated strings as 
follows:

- strcpy(s1, s2); Copies string s2 into string s1.
- strcat(s1, s2); Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
- strlen(s1); Returns the length of string s1.
- strcmp(s1, s2); Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
- strchr(s1, ch); Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
- strstr(s1, s2); Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.

#### ALGORITHM:

 Step 1: Start. 
 
 Step 2: Read main string **STR**, pattern string **PAT** and replace string**REP**.
 
Step 3: Search / find the pattern string PAT in the main string STR.

Step 4: if PAT is found then replace all occurrences of PAT in main string STR with REP string.

Step 5: if PAT is not found give a suitable error message.

Step 6: Stop.
